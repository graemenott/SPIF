Contents of a SPIF file are;


    `root`_
        The root of the SPIF file contains global attributes associated with the file.

    `instrument`_ group
        Data from each instrument channel data is included within a separate group. All metadata relevant to an instrument channel plus universal variables are included in the ``instrument`` root. Many instruments will only have a single channel but in all cases the ``instrument`` group exists to maintain a consistant structure.

    `core`_
        The spif-core group contains the raw image data. Coordinate variables are ``image_num`` and ``pixel``.

    `aux`_
        The spif-aux group contains additional data which is generated by a given instrument but is not required for image processing. This data is included to maintain integrity of the original dataset, making SPIF a suitable format for long term archiving.

    `level-0 <level0>`_
        Particle information and derived parameters in units of ``pixels``/``slices``. Coordinate variable is ``particle``.

    level-1
        Particle information and derived parameters in physical units. Coordinate variable is ``particle``.

    level-2
        Higher-level, possibly aggregated, data products derived from ``level-1``. Coordinate variable is (probably) ``time``.

    |  **antishatter\_tips**:long\_name = "Use of antishatter-, or Korolev-, tips on probe arms" ;


.. _core:

Instrument Core Group
---------------------

.. TODO::
    :class: warning

    Should this ``core`` group exist or just have all the raw data in the ``instrument`` group root?

The instrument ``core`` group contains the raw image data. Variables should exist for all of the information contained for each image in the source binary file. Thus this is a true raw dataset. The unlimited dimensions are ``image_num`` and ``pixel`` where ``max(image_num)`` is the number of images in the dataset and ``max(pixel)`` is the total number of pixels of data in the flattened image array.

.. Note::
    Each image may in fact contain multiple particles. As the ``core`` group is entirely raw data, there has been no processing to split out the multiple particles from a single image.

The arrival time of each image is given by ``time``. The units are in nanoseconds from the reference ``start\_time``, this is defined in the ``time:units`` attribute using the CF format.

Variables in the ``core`` group include;

**Dimensions:**

    | image_num

**Variables:**

    | *int* **image** (pixel)
    |  **image**:long\_name = "Flattened 1d array of images" ;

    | *float* **timestamp** (image_num)
    |  **time**:standard_name = "time" ;
    |  **time**:timezone = "UTC" ;
    |  **time**:long_name = "image arrival time in nanoseconds from reference start time" ;
    |  **time**:units = "nanoseconds since <start_time>" ;
    |  **time**:ancillary_variables = instrument/start_time ;

    | *int* **startpixel** (image_num)
    |  **startpixel**:long\_name = "Array index of first image slice" ;

    | *int* **width** (image_num)
    |  **width**:long\_name = "Number of pixels across image" ;
    |  **width**:units = "pixels" ;

    | *int* **height** (image_num)
    |  **height**:long\_name = "Number of slices/lines in image" ;
    |  **height**:units = "lines" ;

    | *int* **overload** (image_num)
    |  **overload**:long\_name = "Data quality flag for each image" ;
    |  **overload**:flag_values = "0, 1" ;
    |  **overload**:flag_meanings, "good bad" ;


.. admonition:: A word on data types

    The above dtypes are given in the broadest terms as the definitions do not *require* a specific type of *integer* or *float*. However, significant savings in terms of file size and memory usage can be made by using the following dtypes (given in terms of `netCDF <http://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/#variables-in-a-netcdf-file>`_ and `numpy <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html>`_ dtypes);

       | **image**: 'u1' or np.uint8
       | **timestamp**: 'f4' or np.float32
       | **startpixel**: 'u8' or np.uint64
       | **width**: 'u4' or np.uint32
       | **height**: 'u4' or np.uint32
       | **flag**: 'u1' or np.uint8


.. _aux:

Auxillary Data Group
--------------------

.. note:: The ``aux`` group is an optional SPIF feature.

The instrument ``aux`` group contains auxiliary data relevant to a given instrument. This data may be included to maintain integrity of the original dataset, making SPIF a suitable format for long term archiving. This group has its own ``time`` coordinate; this accommodates 1 Hz one dimensional data that may be transmitted in parallel to the two dimensional image data. The ``aux`` group is optional and may include useful data such as;

    * Housekeeping data
    * Buffer time stamps
    * Image counters
    * Data acquisition timing words
    * Temperature
    * Altitude
    * Air speed


.. _tas:

Auxillary Air Speed Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The speed at which particles travel through the probe sample volume is an important parameter for further processing. It allows;

    * the ``array_rate`` of an OAP to be converted into physical resolution and so particles sizes to be calculated,
    * the calculation of sample volume and so higher-order microphysical parameters like particle number concentration, liquid water content, etc.

Airspeed, particularly when it comes to aircraft, is hardly straight forward however in this situation we are interested in true airspeed (TAS) and probe airspeed (PAS). The airspeed at the probe may not be the same as that at a more central location due to local flow perturbations. Post-flight corrections may be required to the TAS applied at time of measurement to comensate for this and other effects.

.. TODO::
    :class: warning

    Two options exist here, firstly a **TAS\_corrected** variable that may not be present if no correction applicable. Or a **TAS\_correction** variable that is alway present but which has a default of 1.

If TAS is included then it should have the following form;

    | *float* **TAS\_original** (time)
    |  **TAS\_original**:long_name = "True Air Speed (TAS) as applied to the auxilary data at time of acquisition" ;
    |  **TAS\_original**:units = "m/s" ;
    |  **TAS\_original**:ancillary_variables = instrument/aux/TAS\_correction ;

    | *float* **TAS\_correction** (time)
    |  **TAS\_correction**:long_name = "Correction factor for true air speed at the probe. Probe Air Speed (PAS) is TAS\_original * TAS\_correction. Default is 1." ;
    |  **TAS\_correction**:units = "dimensionless" ;
    |  **TAS\_correction**:_Fillvalue = 1 ;
    |  **TAS\_correction**:ancillary_variables = instrument/aux/TAS\_original ;

or

    | *float* **TAS\_corrected** (time)
    |  **TAS\_corrected**:long_name = "Corrected true air speed at the probe." ;
    |  **TAS\_corrected**:units = "m/s" ;



.. _level0:

Level-0 Processed Data Group
----------------------------

.. note:: The ``level-0`` group is an optional SPIF feature.

Following extraction of image data into SPIF format, images can be analyzed to extract information about the particles they contain. At the most basic level, parameters of interest describe geometric and physical measurements of the identified particles. Thus, the level 0 data contains basic information about identified particles such as;

    * `Diameters`_ (more discussion on this below)
    * Area
    * Perimeter
    * Bounding box within image
    * Orientation
    * Right edge pixel count
    * Left edge pixel count
    * Center-in (boolean)
    * All-in (boolean)

Note that the level 0 particles are sized using number of pixels - conversion to sizing in microns takes place in Level 1.

Each of the parameters discussed above applies to individual particles. For most imaging probes there can be multiple particles in a single image. Given this *n*-to-one relationship, the Level 0 particle data will require use of a new dimension corresponding to the number of particles detected, which is likely to be different than the number of images captured. The particles dimension thus covers all parameters described in this section. With the additional dimension, there is a need for supplemental parameters which describe the relationship of detected particles to their original image, both in terms of a reference to the additional image, as well as a more exact temporal location, based on the particle’s location in the image frame.

A list of possible level 0 variables are given on :doc:`this page <spif_optional_params>`.

Variables in the ``level0`` group may include;

**Dimensions:**

    | particle_num

**Variables:**

    | *int* **image\_index** (particle_num)
    |  **image\_index**:long\_name = "Reference to image\_num index of image containing current particle" ;
    |  **image\_index**:ancillary_variables = instrument/core/image\_num ;

    | *float* **N\_p** (particle_num)
    |  **N\_p**:long_name = "Max diameter of particle in the photodiode-array dimension" ;
    |  **N\_p**:units = "pixels" ;
    |  **N\_p**:references =  ;


.. _level1:

Level-1 Processed Data Group
----------------------------

.. note:: The ``level-1`` group is an optional SPIF feature.


Whereas Level 0 data presents particle information as simply properties of an image, Level 1 contains particle properties linked to physical, real-world quantities. In Level 1, there are two primary categories of data:

    #. Particle properties scaled to physical dimensions (μm, etc.) using the resolution of the instrument,
    #. Parameters classifying particles into habits or other categories.

As discussed in `tas`_, when generating scaled particle properties, care must be taken to correct for improper scaling in the image time direction due to inconsistencies between the probe sampling rate and the speed of the aircraft. These inconsistencies can happen for various reasons the most common include; exceeding TAS limits of the probe, having incorrect or constant airspeed inputs supplied to the probe, or problems with local pitot measurements due to icing or other blockages.

As the ``level-1`` group is a sub-group of ``level-0``, the ``level-1`` group inherits the ``particle_num`` dimension. A ``pas`` (or probe air speed) variable gives the correct true air speed at the probe for each particle derived from the TAS variables in the ``aux`` group.

.. TODO::
    :class: warning

    The PAS variable is just an idea...

A list of possible level 0 variables are given on :doc:`this page <spif_optional_params>` and may include for example;

**Variables:**

    | *int* **PAS** (particle_num)
    |  **PAS**:long\_name = "Probe Air Speed (PAS) derived from the True Air Speed (TAS) variables in the auxilary data group" ;
    |  **PAS**:units = "m/s" ;

    | *float* **D\_p** (particle_num)
    |  **D\_p**:long_name = "Max diameter of particle in the photodiode-array dimension" ;
    |  **D\_p**:units = "um" ;
    |  **D\_p**:equivalent_name = "D_y, L5" ;
    |  **D\_p**:references =  ;


.. _Diameters:

Diameter definitions
--------------------

    Interpretation of particle diameter presents a challenge, as there are currently several definitions of particle diameter in use by the community, and a standard definition likely isn’t reasonable, since different diameters are useful depending on the measurement scenario. Thus, to make SPIF useful to the broader community, it may include a wide set of diameters in use by the community. An additional consideration for the inclusion of various particle diameters is how these diameters are named. Throughout the literature, varying names have been given to essentially identical diameters. In the diameter definitions here, an attempt will be made to standardize the names, while referencing other names used for a given diameter definition.
