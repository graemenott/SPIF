The SPIF group structure is below with optional groups shown in *italics*

    |   root

    |   ├── instrument 1
    |   │   ├── "core"
    |   │   ├── *"aux"*

    |   :

The instrument group names are those of a specific instrument, further information is included as attributes of these groups. Contents of each of the groups is;


    `root`_
        The root of the SPIF file contains global attributes associated with the file.

    `instrument`_ group
        Each instrument data included within the file has a separate group. All metadata relevant to an instrument plus universal variables are included in the instrument root.

    `core`_
        The spif-core group contains the raw image data. Coordinate variable is ``image``.

    `aux`_
        The spif-aux group contains additional data which is generated by a given instrument but is not required for image processing. This data is included to maintain integrity of the original dataset, making SPIF a suitable format for long term archiving.

    `level-0 <level0>`_
        Particle information and derived parameters in units of ``pixels``/``slices``. Coordinate variable is ``particle``.

    level-1
        Particle information and derived parameters in physical units. Coordinate variable is ``particle``.

    level-2
        Higher-level, possibly aggregated, data products derived from ``level-1``. Coordinate variable is (probably) ``time``.


.. _root:

--------------------
SPIF Root Attributes
--------------------

Each SPIF file has a standardised set of attributes in the root. These attributes are;

    :Conventions: "SPIF-n.m"        (where n.m is the specification version)
    :title: Short description of dataset contents

    :comment: Any further information pertaining to this data

Any other attributes that apply to this dataset can be included in the root.


.. _instrument:

The root of the instrument group contains attributes pertaining to that specific instrument. Instrument group attributes are currently not mandatory but may include;

    :instrument_name: Short name of instrument

    :raw_filenames: Raw data filename(s) used to generate the current instrument dataset
    :comment: = Any further notes about instrument, platform, location, orientation, etc;

Universal variables may also be included in the instrument group root. For example;

    *int* pixel(pixel)
        pixel:long_name = "Vector of pixel numbers for instrument";

    *int* bit(bit)
        bit:long_name = "pixel bit";

    *int* value(bit)
        bit:long_name = "Value of shadow level in image array";

        bit:ancillary_variables = shadow;

    *float* shadow(bit)
        shadow:long_name = "Fractional obscuration of photodiode array for each bit value";

    |   *float* **resolution**
    |       **resolution**:long_name = "Physical resolution of array pixels instrument";
    |       **resolution**:units = "micrometer";
    |       **resolution**:ancillary_variables = instrument/resolution_err;

    *float* clockstep
        resolution:long_name = "Temporal resolution of clock. Along with airspeed defines the physical resolution in the flight direction";

        resolution:units = "nanosecond";

    *float* arm_separation
        arm_separation:long_name = "Physical distance between probe arms";

        arm_separation:units = "micrometer";

        arm_separation:ancillary_variables = instrument/arm_separation_err;

    *boolean* antishatter_tips
        antishatter_tips:long_name = "Use of antishatter-, or Korolev-, tips on probe arms";


.. _core:

Instrument Core Group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The instrument ``core`` group contains the raw image data. Variables should exist for all of the information contained for each image in the source binary file. Thus this is a true raw dataset. The incrementing dimension is ``image``. The start time for the *nth* image is given by the sum of ``particle_sec``(*n*) and ``particle_ns``(*n*). The 2-dimensional images have additional dimensions ``slice`` and ``array``. The ``slice`` dimension corresponds to the image dimension in the direction of flight and is set as the maximum number of slices encountered (or allowed) by the instrument. The ``array`` dimension corresponds to the image dimension along the diode array, and is set as the number of diodes of the instrument.

Variables in the ``core`` group are;

    *int* image(image)
        image:long_name = "Index of image";

    *int* image_sec(image)
        image_sec:standard_name = "time";

        image_sec:long_name = "image arrival time in seconds";

        image_sec:timezone = "UTC";

        image_sec:units = "seconds since "...;

    *float* image_ns(image)
        image_ns:long_name = "image arrival time in nanoseconds from corresponding image_sec";

        image_ns:units = "nanoseconds";

        image_ns:ancillary_variables = instrument/core/image_sec;

    *float* image_len(image)
        image_len:long_name = "image event length in number of slices";

        image_len:units = "dimensionless";

    *int* images(image, slice, pixel)
        images:long_name = "image array";


.. _aux:

Auxillary Data Group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: The ``aux`` group is an optional SPIF feature.

The instrument ``aux`` group contains auxiliary data relevant to a given instrument. This data may be included to maintain integrity of the original dataset, making SPIF a suitable format for long term archiving. This group has its own ``time`` coordinate; this accommodates 1 Hz one dimensional data that may be transmitted in parallel to the two dimensional image data. The ``aux`` group is optional and may include useful data such as;

    * Housekeeping data
    * Buffer time stamps
    * Image counters
    * Data acquisition timing words
    * Temperature
    * Altitude


.. _level0:

Level-0 Processed Data Group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: The ``level-0`` group is an optional SPIF feature.

Following extraction of image data into SPIF format, images can be analyzed to extract information about the particles they contain. At the most basic level, parameters of interest describe geometric and physical measurements of the identified particles. Thus, the level 0 data contains basic information about identified particles such as;

    * Diameters (more discussion on this below)
    * Area
    * Perimeter
    * Bounding box within image
    * Orientation
    * Right edge pixel count
    * Left edge pixel count
    * Center-in (boolean)
    * All-in (boolean)

Note that the level 0 particles are sized using number of pixels - conversion to sizing in microns takes place in Level 1.


Diameter definitions:
"""""""""""""""""""""

    Interpretation of particle diameter presents a challenge, as there are currently several definitions of particle diameter in use by the community, and a standard definition likely isn’t reasonable, since different diameters are useful depending on the measurement scenario. Thus, to make SPIF useful to the broader community, it should include a wide set of diameters in use by the community. An additional consideration for the inclusion of various particle diameters is how these diameters are named. Throughout the literature, varying names have been given to essentially identical diameters. In the diameter definitions here, an attempt will be made to standardize the names, while referencing other names used for a given diameter definition.


Each of the parameters discussed above applies to individual particles. For most OAPs, there can be multiple particles in a single image. Given this n-to-one relationship, the Level 0 particle data will require use of a new dimension corresponding to the number of particles detected, which is likely to be different than the number of images captured. The particles dimension thus covers all parameters described in this section. With the additional dimension, there is a need for supplemental parameters which describe the relationship of detected particles to their original image, both in terms of a reference to the additional image, as well as a more exact temporal location, based on the particle’s location in the image frame.
